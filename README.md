# Laundry Management System - C++

## Description  
This project is developed in **C++** for managing the operations of a laundry service, providing a robust and scalable application focused on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles**.

## Key Features  
- **OOP and Design Patterns** – Application of **Object-Oriented Programming** principles, including **design patterns** to ensure scalable and maintainable code.  
- **Memory Management** – Optimized memory handling through dynamic allocation, guaranteeing high performance even for complex operations.  
- **Time Handling** – Advanced logic system for managing appointments and service durations, synchronizing application operations with **real-time**.  
- **Dynamic Interface** – The application supports adding, modifying, and deleting appointments in real-time with efficient resource management.

## Technologies and Concepts Used  
- **Language:** C++  
- **Principles:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
